this package uses **tsup** which is incompatible with **npm** package manager, so it is recommended use **yarn** or **pnpm** instead

if not installed use this command to install it globally **npm install --global yarn** or **npm install -g pnpm**

run **yarn** and **yarn dev** in both packages

The frontend is exposed at **http://localhost:3000**
